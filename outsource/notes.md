>The philosopher can only do one per time.

Forks: There are as many forks as philosophers.
>One fork per philosopher.

The philosopher needs to eat with 2 forks, this means that he will take a fork of another philosopher. So, the philosopher that is just on the side can't eat while this is eating.

When a philo finish eating -> but the fork on the table and start sleeping.

Once awake, they start thinking again.

The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.

>every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
>philosopher dont speak with each other.
>philosopher dont know if another philosopher is about to die.
>Philosophers should avoid dying!
